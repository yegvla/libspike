A HAL for the STM32H723.  Not complete and probably never will be at
this point, but basic things (clock, gpio, interrupts) already /seem/
to work.  Structure and interface somewhat inspired by libopencm3.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository contains a collection of firmware, libraries and
applications to work with the spike hardware.  See the provided
LICENSE file for licensing information.

WHAT IS WHAT ?


libspike/	A abstraction layer to the STM32H723.  It will
		produce a libspike.a file and includes a standard
		C library.

spikeboot/	A bootloader with USB support, sits at the bottom of
		the hardware and provides way for communicating with
		the host.

libboot/	A library for interacting with the bootloader for
		programs sitting above.  It will produce libboot.a.

spike-run/	A host application for interacting with the bootloader.



HOW TO BUILD ?


To build everything just run make.  The bootloader can be compiled
with SEGGER RTT support, this will redirect output from the `_write'
syscall to the RTT console.  See the Makefile for further information.

Run `make libspike.c' to just build the library without the
bootloader.x
